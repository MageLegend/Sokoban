# Sokoban

Sokoban is a puzzle game that was originally made in 1982. Slightly longer than half a year ago i started writing it in Java for a college assignment, without any code or examples to base it on but the actual rules of the game itself. The deadline for this assignment was somewhere in early march 2017. What i had made at the time of the deadline was a working recreation of a single Sokoban, however i was unsatisfied with my own result as i had started working too late on this assignment which caused my project by the deadline to remain incomplete. This is why i continued working on it even after the deadline, and recently i've been feeling like sharing my progress so far on github, so here it is. I'll continue working on this project and update the code on here whenever i feel like it.

If you wish to use this code for your own benefit/personal use, like using it for your own college assignments for example, then i won't stop you, but please don't take this code, post it elsewhere and claim it as your own. I do not own the rights to the idea of Sokoban itself, nor to the majority of the assets used in this project.

This project was made in Java, with the use of JavaFX for the creation of a UI, using the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) design pattern.
Keep in mind that some directory, class, variable and method names are written in Dutch.
